# 🔍 URL Analysis System

A smart, ML-powered system to analyze URLs for potential threats, phishing characteristics, and structural patterns. Combines data extraction, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to classify URLs as **benign** or **malicious**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. URL Feature Extraction Pipeline
- Extracts over 20+ technical and behavioral features from URLs
- Detects length, domain count, use of special characters, and redirection
- Identifies suspicious patterns such as IP usage, encoded strings, and shorteners
- Supports batch processing of multiple URLs

### 2. Machine Learning Classification
- Trained on real-world phishing datasets
- Supports models like:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **XGBoost** (for advanced scoring)
- Provides probability/confidence score for each URL

### 3. Real-Time Scoring Dashboard
- Simple, responsive UI built with **React + Tailwind CSS**
- Input single or multiple URLs for instant classification
- Color-coded labels: ✅ Safe, ⚠️ Suspicious, ❌ Malicious
- Real-time response via backend API

### 4. Backend Service Layer
- **FastAPI** server for efficient REST API communication
- Input validation, sanitization, and logging
- Scalable endpoints for prediction and batch classification

### 5. URL Metadata & Enrichment (Optional)
- WHOIS lookup and DNS resolution (optional layer)
- Fetch page title, SSL certificate info
- Time-to-live (TTL) and DNS propagation delays
